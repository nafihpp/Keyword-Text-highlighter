##Features 
Users can search for a keyword using the keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl+F</code>, which will open a pop-up window containing an input box to enter the search.
Once a keyword is entered, all instances of the keyword within the page content will be highlighted with a light yellow color and the total count of matches will be displayed in the Modal.
Users can navigate through the search results by clicking the "next" button in the pop-up window. Each new match will be highlighted with a darker orange color.
When no more matches are available, the "next" button will go to the first and vice versa for "prev".
